# Monkey Interpreter

I've always been interested in the inner working of compilers and interpreters. To learn the basics of this and to practice my go, I've decided to work through a book that was recommended to me!

The book in question is _Writing An Interpreter In Go_ by **Thorsten Ball**, which can be bought at https://interpreterbook.com/.

I'd recommend picking up this book and working through it yourself, but I'll also be putting up the source code as I've written it in this repo, so feel free to take a look!

The interpreter in question will be written without the use of any external Go libraries, and is meant to build the Monkey Programming Language. Monkey has a C-like syntax, supports variable bindings, prefix and infix operators, has first-class and higher-order functions, can handle closures with ease and has integers, booleans, arrays and hashes built-in.
